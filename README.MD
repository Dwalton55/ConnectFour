                                                    Connect Four

For this project, I created a Connect Four Game that allows two players on the same terminal to play against each other. 
The game asks players to click start to begin the game, and lets the player know that player one is blue and player two is orange.
The game has a 7X6 grid or seven columns with six row elements. The players click on the column that they would like to place their color in
and a tile of their color drops to the lowest unfilled row in that column. If a player manages to have four consequtive grid elements, whether
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the board, the player whose color corresponds to that series is declared a winner and his or her score increases by one.
Players take turns being the first one to start playing, between rounds. Players are also given an option to reset the counter of
player scores and to begin anew with a whole new series of games.

The challenges of the project
  -Creating a 2 dimensional array to represent the visual grid that players interact with.
  -Making that array responsive to the actions of the player on the screen
  -Working with a top down array while the visual grid is bottom up.
  -Checking the game for when the player has made a winning move.
  -Determining which player should be declared winner at time of winning.
  -Accounting for outlier cases such as filling all grids without a clear winner. 
  -Checking values across a two dimensional array in a diagonal manner.
  
  
 The theme of this project borrows from the Tron Series.
